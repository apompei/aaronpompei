                  <h2>Research Statement</h2>
                  <p class="lead">Cities need to implement human-centered design practice and thinking to produce positive reciprocal benefit through strategies, policy, and urban development to empower citizens to increase community cohesion and individual agency for the long term benefits of personal satisfaction, reduce crime, increase self-sufficiency, and improve the overall well-being of all residence.</p>
                    <h3>What do you want to argue?</h3>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Design, data, and technology can be combined to empower citizens to increase social cohesion and personal satisfaction, reduce crime, increase self-sufficiency, and improve overall well-being. (transformation design)</li>
                        <li>The smart city of today should aspire to empower its citizens more than just improve its own efficiency.</li>
                        <li>IoT will exponentially shift how citizens and city government can co-create mutual value reducing the separation between government and citizens as well as the economic and social divides among citizens.</li>
                        <li>The Zero UI concept coupled with service orientation can fundamentally and positively reshape the city landscape while exponentially increasing the quality of life, citizen engagement, and urban sustainability.</li>
                        <li>The digital urban garden will help your community flourish. - As more municipal services are installed with digital data endpoints cities should be looking at leveraging and providing this data to its citizens. The creation of an urban suite of digitally mediated services can have profound positive impact on the malaise of urban living. Making way for more productive and meaningful citizen interaction, contact with nature through a reduction in municipal urban infrastructure, greater efficiency in citizen / municipal exchanges through greater municipal transparency and citizen engagement. Micro-effects of the digital urban garden begin to have positive gain with a citizenship that co-creates policy and build value and satisfaction for all citizens within their respective communities.</li>
                      </ol>
                    <h3>Why are you arguing it?</h3>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Where are the benefits of greater efficiency being re-applied? The first stage of many new technologies is about efficiency and this lacks transparency and is a half measure lacking any extended strategy that will have an impact on those paying for such shifts.</li>
                        <li>Cities manage themselves through outdated processes that are opaque and slow. The demand on the citizenry to engage these systems detract from more fulfilling and meaningful activity.</li>
                        <li>With the amount of data generated through municipal organizations and related entities and the continuing proliferation of citizen owned mobile devices as access enables the cities of today and tomorrow should seek to proactively and reactively narrow the quality-of-life and social cohesion divides existing among its citizens.</li>
                        <li>Too many communities suffer from addressable challenges in part attributed to a malign government who provide more attention to the affluent segments of society while creating generalized “solutions” to pacify the less affluent communities.</li>
                      </ol>
                    <h3>What made you personally interested in it?</h3>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Systems thinking</li>
                        <li>IoT</li>
                        <li>Data</li>
                        <li>Mobile Crowd Sensing</li>
                        <li>Crowd / Community Organization</li>
                        <li>Public Action for the digital age</li>
                        <li>General disappointment with our collective ability to produce a kinder and respectful social order based on basic human values to help anyone in need.</li>
                        <li>Keen awareness of how our surroundings influence and affect our perceptions quality, class, health, and safety. All key factors in self-motivating.</li>
                        <li>An opportunity to disrupt systematic inequality among people framed by the conditions of labor, commerce, and governance.</li>
                      </ol>
                    <h2>A Rational</h2>
                      <p>Urban populations are predicted to increase exponentially by 2050 to sustain such massive growth local governments will need stronger collaborative relationships with its citizens. The danger of maintaining operations with incremental change is radical increases poverty, crime, public health epidemics, and costs of operations. Transformative innovation is needed to produce cohesive communities that are self-reliant and determined for peaceful, sustainable, and safe cohabitation. Social, behavioral, and design research being examined from over the last decade and contextual inquiry conducted with participants will connect HCD principles to the design and application of policy, process, and infrastructure to continue the progression of cities from reactive, to responsive, and on to proactive entities that orientates itself to citizens as collaborators rather than consumers.</p>
                      <h3>Why is this topic important?</h3>
                        <p>To change the way we as people engage with our local governments and each other. Rather than continuing a dizzying race to the bottom for individual affluence with little regard for the benefits of collective action and support along with a longer life span where we all eventually need the support and help of others.</p>
                      <h3>What does it contribute to the field?</h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>This project seeks to look at how near-real-time data shared from a municipality and locally generated from communities can merge to become actionable and sustain fundamental changes for people within communities facing base challenges of health, well-being, and safety.</li>
                          <li>A key question being asked is When data is visualized in understandable and actionable terms will it increase community cohesion and greater agency among members of the community to advocate and rejuvenate their community to catalyze collective action and benefit within any community.</li>
                        </ol>
                      <h3>What research has been done?</h3>
                        <ol>
                          <li>There’s about a decade's worth of social science research on community cohesion and factors that positively or negatively impact social and community cohesion, well-being, and self-determination.</li>
                          <li>A handful of cases studies is published on the use of crowdsensing for other philanthropic endeavors such as food drives and healthcare.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>I will need to identify research on the following:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>access to public data</li>
                            <li>smart city initiatives and outcomes</li>
                            <li>Designing for motivation</li>
                            <li>Organizing communities</li>
                          </ul>
